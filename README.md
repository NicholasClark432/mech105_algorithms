# LUP Factor 
LUP factor is a code I wrote for MECH 105, where essentially, I needed to develop an algorithm to be able to perform linear algebra, while storing the Coefficients used to find each variable into a L matrix, while keeping the remaining values left in the equation stored in a U matrix. The P matrix tracks the pivots of each equation while the algorithm solves for each independent variable.

## So in this code you will find:
* An L matrix 
* A U matrix 
* A P matrix 

### In order to run this code, all you will need to input is the system of equations, the outputs are just L,U,P
